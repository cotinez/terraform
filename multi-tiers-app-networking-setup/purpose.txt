This is a typical base network in AWS cloud to host a highly available in a single region (us-east-1) multi-tiers application.

There is 3 common layers (Web, Application and database) and a fourth for an addition layer if needed.

Note: 
- This can be easily extended to additional availability zones in the same region.
- For global availability, it's possible to deploy the same network in a different region and failover between them using Route53.
